# What is NPC flipping in Hypixel Skyblock?
Npc flipping is a form of flipping that involves you setting buy orders for an item with high volume but under the NPC price.

# How does it do it?
It will first scan the Skyblock item API for a list of all items and then compare it to the Bazaar API to list only items available in the Bazaar.
Then it will check for the balance of the most profit margin and the highest volume + You can set a minimum volume/hr and price, so you don't have to buy 70k hardstone for 7k :sob: ifykyk

# How can I use it?
You can download the source and run it with a Python interpreter, but I also include the PyInstaller packages in the release tab, too, in the form of two .exe

# What is display.py
It has no real logic; it only shows the file that the main script generates as a transparent overlay, always on top of all windows. It's not necessary.

# How to contact me
I am ._.hesam._. on Discord, you can message and send suggestions and feedback, and ideas for next projects.

As much as you'd like, but I am not responsible for anything that breaks Hypixel's tos or may cause damage, it's all on you.
